# Container Central
A totally minimalist, not quite ready for prime time, but still pretty good solution for managing Docker containers on Raspberry Pi and WSL2.

## What is it?
Container Central is a web-based management tool for Docker containers that focuses on the needs of the home LAN user. My target is a Raspberry Pi running Docker Community Edition and a handful of containers. That's it.

## Why?
There are pleny of full-featured container management apps out there. Portainer is one of my favorites. But all the ones I've looked at have "enterprise features" in an attempt to get you to pay for a license rather than using the "community version".

I'm running a single Raspberry Pi in my home. I trust my users. I have no need for any advanced features like role based access and Active Directory integration. I just want simple.

Like most open source developers, I had an itch and I scratched it. This is the product.

## How can I use it?
Get the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/davescodemusings/container-central) and run it. This is probably the easiest method. There's a [Quick Start](docs/QuickStart.md) document to get you up and going with minimal hassle.

When you're done with that, take a look at the [other docs](docs/) to explore more features of Container Central.

## Where's all this going?
Currently, Container Central can manage just about all of the container management tasks I typically need. There are more features to add, but I'm starting small and working my way up. If you're interested, keep an eye on the [issues list](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/container-central/issues)

But please remeber, this is a hobby, not a business venture.

## Are there screenshots or what???
You betcha!

(Mobile device screenshots were taken in dusk mode.)
